        <strong>Like you, we realize that Philly has a litter problem.</strong> Not In Philly provides residents with the tools needed to quickly and easily clean their block on their own schedule, asking for just a 6-month, once a week commitment to clean their neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not in Philly is prepared to resource any neighborhood where we find the funding ($2,500 for a typically sized neighborhood). We are looking for Philly businesses to lend a hand in addressing this issue we all hate.
    </p>
    <p>
        This innovative program is the first and only map-based platform for easy street adoption. Not In Philly offers a low cost and time effective solution that easily puts to work a large number of volunteers with huge impact. Since launching in 2016, over 1000 Philadelphians from Moyamensing to Fishtown have signed up. We have press coverage from Philadelphia Magazine, The Philadelphia Inquirer and CBS-3.
