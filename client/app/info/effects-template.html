			<p class="p2 ft7">In a city often referred to as “filthadelphia” by visitors and residents alike, litter is a ubiquitous part of the city. Philadelphia is a regular on Travel and Leisure Magazine’s “Top 20 Dirtiest Cities" ranking #6 in 2016. <span class="ft6">(1) </span>The 2009 “National Visible Litter Survey and Litter Cost Study”, commissioned by Keep America Beautiful, <span class="ft6">(2) </span>confirms what real estate professionals</p>
			<p class="p1 ft8">already know, blight reduces property values and litter is an indicator of blight.</p>
			<p class="p1 ft5">!</p>
			<p class="p3 ft7">To measure these impacts of litter, the study surveyed homeowners, realtors, and business development officials. Here is some of what they found:</p>
			<p class="p4 ft7">•93% of homeowners say a littered neighborhood would decrease their assessment of a home’s value and influences their decision to purchase a property. And 40% estimated that litter would reduce a home’s value by 10% to 24%.</p>
			<p class="p5 ft9"><span class="ft9">•</span><span class="ft10">36% of business development officials say that litter impacts a decision to locate to a community.</span></p>
			<p class="p6 ft9"><span class="ft9">•</span><span class="ft10">55% of realtors think that litter reduces property values by about 9%.</span></p>
			<p class="p6 ft9"><span class="ft9">•</span><span class="ft10">60% of property appraisers would reduce a home’s value if it was littered.</span></p>
			<p class="p6 ft7">•The presence of litter in a community decreases property values by a little over 7%,</p>
			<p class="p1 ft13"><span class="ft11">!</span><span class="ft12">according to the National Association of Home Builders pricing model.</span></p>
			<p class="p7 ft7">Litter is more than an eyesore and a nuisance. It is a measure of the disorderliness that negatively impacts the quality of life for most residents. A 2003 study, "Why is poverty unhealthy?" by Deborah A. Cohen, Thomas A. Farley &amp; Karen Mason, <span class="ft6">(3) </span>calls litter a predictor for many social ails. They cited a decrease in physical activity, increase in crime and poor</p>
			<p class="p1 ft14">relationships between neighbors as some consequences of litter.</p>
			<p class="p1 ft5">!</p>
			<p class="p8 ft15">The problem is obvious, so is the remedy. Projects like “Not In Philly” successfully attack litter, increase civic engagement and encourages neighbors to participate in the solution to the problem.</p>
			<p class="p9 ft13">Not In Philly is a project of Pennsylvania Resources Council.</p>
