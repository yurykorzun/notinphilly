      <dt class="faq-heading">So, what is <strong>Not in Philly</strong> all about?</dt>
      <dd class="faq-body">
        <p>Philadelphia has a litter problem. As citizens, we can make a real difference. We are a network of over 1,200 of your neighbors who have committed to cleaning their block once-a-week of litter.</p> 
      </dd>

      <dt class="faq-heading">Do you supply grabbers in all neighborhoods</dt>
      <dd class="faq-body">
           <p>Right now we only have funding to supply grabbers in <strong>Walnut Hill</strong> and <strong>Spruce Hill</strong>, but we are working as fast as we can to raise more. If you know of funding opportunities please pass them along, or feel free to make a donation yourself using the Donate tab.</p>
          <p>In the meantime don't let our "grabber delay" stop you from adopting and cleaning your block, and we'll get you a grabber as soon as we can.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt class="faq-heading">All I get is a grabber? Isn’t that kind of lame?</dt>
      <dd class="faq-body">
        <p>We agree. <strike>Once enough people sign up, we will be able to solicit gifts from area businesses and hold raffles to improve our rewards.</strike> Hub Bub Coffee has donated gift cards for those who post pictures of their cleaned blocks to @notinphilly and #notinphilly (if your account is public). We’ll have drawings of those who submit content while supplies last. Thank you for being a trailblazer! </p>
      </dd>

      <dt class="faq-heading">What if my block is too large to cover by myself?</dt>
      <dd class="faq-body">
        <p>If you live on a large block, you can take care of just one side of the street.</p>
        <p>Get your neighbors involved! There can be multiple participants for each block.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt class="faq-heading">What if I move or am unable to complete my six month commitment?</dt>
      <dd class="faq-body">
        <p>Please keep the grabber as our gift and eliminate litter wherever you go!</p>
      </dd>

      <dt class="faq-heading">How can I promote <strong>Not in Philly</strong> in my community?</dt>
